Work and Academic Experience
======

2025 - Present	
Bioinformatician at the Statistical Services Unit at QIMR Berghofer

Led initiatives to build bioinformatics capacity within the Statistics Department through seminars, workshops, and laboratory tours, providing conceptual and practical training on genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics/metabolomics workflows. Designed and delivered educational material explaining both experimental techniques (e.g., DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics) and their associated analytical pipelines. Developed an advanced R programming course as a progression from the introductory level course currently being run at QIMRB by the Statistics Unit. This advanced course has a focus on reproducible research practices, version control, and advanced coding skills including tidy data principles, functional programming, control structures, and pipeline modularisation.

2025 - Present	
Sole Trader Independent Bioinformatics consultant/contractor

Provided specialised bioinformatics consulting services, including the analysis of diverse datasets such as 16S microbiome sequencing and single-nucleus multiome sequencing. Engaged by external clients (e.g. Insigene, https://insigene.com/about-us/ ) to perform end-to-end computational workflows encompassing raw data alignment, quality control, advanced statistical and integrative analyses, and preparation of publication-ready visualisations. Delivered reproducible, well-documented reports with an emphasis on mechanistic interpretation and translational insights, ensuring clients received not only descriptive summaries but also deeper biological context to guide research directions.

2025	
Data Analyst and Admin Officer at the Thoracic and Sleep Group Queensland, Wesley Hospital

Managed clinical operations including patient bookings, phone enquiries, and client interactions. Coordinated medical records by preparing and organising patient files and histories for physician review. Developed automation pipelines to streamline checklisting processes, improving workflow efficiency. Conducted statistical analyses of CPAP and sleep study datasets to identify comorbidities and disease-associated patterns, as well as investigating differential treatment responses among narcolepsy and hypersomnia patients.


2021 - 2025	
PhD project “Using single cell technology to decipher mechanism of tolerance education” QIMR Berghofer, Mucosal Immunology Laboratory

My project investigates the mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory protein 2 (AIP-2), which provides long-term protection against allergic inflammation across mucosal tissues. I study transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in conventional type 1 dendritic cells and regulatory CD4⁺ T cells using single-cell and bulk RNA and ATAC sequencing. In parallel, I analyse immune cell responses in a dietary model known to expand mucosal Tregs. By comparing mechanisms and signalling pathways across these systems, I aim to uncover drivers of immune tolerance and tissue repair. My work spans both wet lab techniques (animal dissection, tissue culture, flow cytometry, proteomics, microbiome sequencing) and dry lab analyses (sequencing data processing, pathway analysis in Qiagen IPA, and high-performance computing). I am proficient in R, Bash, and Python.

2019 - 2020	
Summer Research Project The University of Queensland, SCIE3260 course, Blanchfield Laboratory

In this research project I isolated natural products from traditional medicinal plants using HPLC and characterised their structures using H-NMR, UV spectrography and LC-MS/MS. Additionally, I was culturing a human cell line, caco-2 cells, in preparation to test the permeability of the isolated natural products across the in vitro model of gut epithelium.

2018-2021	
Primary and High School Tutor Both privately and with Tutor2You

Provided personalised tutoring in Mathematics, English, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and introductory Spanish to students from primary through secondary school. Delivered over 50 successful tutoring engagements across four years, developing strong organisational, pedagogical, and communication skills. Independently managed scheduling, client relations, and financial transactions, demonstrating professionalism and the ability to adapt teaching strategies to diverse learning needs and age groups.

2023-present
  Co-founder of QIMR Coding hub: QIMR coding hub is an institute wide resource and club I founded with Isabela Almeida, a fellow PhD student, which aims to provide a space for dry lab researchers to network, learn new skills, and troubleshoot problems. We currently host fortnightly coding sessions where we work together to resolve errors and have open discussions regarding any posed coding related problems. We also aim to host a workshop every month where researchers at all levels may learn new coding and analysis related skills.
