Profile
======

I am passionate about understanding the development of immune tolerance and translating this knowledge into novel immunotherapeutic strategies for atopic and inflammatory diseases. My expertise spans single-cell and bulk sequencing, genetic data integration, and signalling pathway analysis. I have a strong interest in computational immunology and leverage high-dimensional data to define disease states, uncover regulatory networks, and dissect therapeutically exploitable molecular mechanisms that drive immune dysfunction and tolerance.
