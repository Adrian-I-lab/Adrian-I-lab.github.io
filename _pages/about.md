## Profile

I am passionate about understanding the development of immune tolerance and translating these insights into novel immunotherapeutic strategies for atopic and inflammatory diseases.  

My expertise spans:

- **Single-cell and bulk transcriptomics**
- **Multiome (RNA+ATAC) sequencing**
- **Genetic data integration**
- **Regulatory network inference (SCENIC+, TFBS, chromatin accessibility)**
- **Pathway and systems immunology analysis**
- **Reproducible bioinformatics workflows**

I am particularly interested in **computational immunology**, where I develop and apply high-dimensional analytical frameworks to define disease states, uncover regulatory networks, and dissect therapeutically exploitable molecular mechanisms that drive immune dysfunction and tolerance.
